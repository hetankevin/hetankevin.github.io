Two papers accepted to NeurIPS 2024! These are on how [hybrid RL can break sample size barriers in linear MDPs](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/d9251dc20346dffe9b6db86dcc6f8cc9-Abstract-Conference.html) and [solving distributed least squares problems in small space with randomized algorithms for matrix sketching](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/poster/93417). I've also received the **NeurIPS Travel Award**!
